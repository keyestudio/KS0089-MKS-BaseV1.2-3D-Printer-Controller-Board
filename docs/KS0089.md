## 1. Intruduction

The new MKS Base 1.2 3D Printer Controller board combines and improves the assets of the RAMPS 1.4 and Arduino Mega 2560 boards on a fantastic single board solution. The MKS Base 1.2 is an optimal 3D printer controller solution for your Reprap 3D Printer.

## 2. Main features

- The MKS Base 1.2 solves interface connection problems between the Arduino Mega 2560 and RAMPS 1.4 boards by having both integrated into a single board
- 5 Stepper Motor Driver Slots. The boards supports a wide variety of Stepper Motor Drivers - most notably A4988, DRV8825 and Ice-Blue Stepper Motor drivers drive
- The MKS Base 1.2 board uses a high quality 4-layer PCB which optimizes heat dissipation
- Firmware can use the same configuration as RAMPS 1.4
- Easy DISPLAY + SD-CARD connector - compatible pin header on board for 12864 & 2004 LCD Display controller panels.
- 6x end stop connectors with power supply Xmin/Xmax/Ymin/Ymax/Zmin/Zmax
- 3 x 5V output, 3 x Power voltage output
- Reserve motor pulse and direction output port
- Support 12V-24V power input

B. Click Printer Settings to complete some setup, referring to below figure.

![](media/24.png)

C. Enter Object Placement to set placing position, printing size and so on.

D. Click Slicer to set slicer, like printing speed. After setting slicer, click Start Slicing to begin slicing.

![](media/27.png)

E. After slicing, go to Preview→G-Code Editor, copy G-Code to SD card, and then insert the card into the main board. It is time to kick off the print! Though the LCD screen go to : Print from SD→Desired File. Or you can connect your 3D printer to computer using a USB cable to start the print.

G. We just introduce a simple method about printing. Thanks to selling only main board by us, you should design your own structure and outlook of your 3D printer, and you should also set your own configuration to meet your need. After you assembling your printer, the printer need to be leveled, so you can make some setup in Preview and Manual Control, and surf the internet for further information.
